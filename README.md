# AdventOfCode_2024

Repo of my solutions to this year's puzzles found at https://adventofcode.com/

As usual all of my initial solutions are completely hintless and unassisted, this year I am focused on having solutions that run as fast as fast as possible, so some 'Improved' solutions after the initial solve may involve me researching better approaches and implementing them

This year will be entirely in C++ so that its gimmicks settle in my long term memory, enjoy the marginal shifts in my code style as I learn
