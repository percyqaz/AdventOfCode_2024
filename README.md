# AdventOfCode_2024

Repo of my solutions to this year's puzzles found at https://adventofcode.com/

As usual all of my initial solutions are completely hintless and unassisted other than using a language reference



This year will be entirely in C++ so that its gimmicks settle in my long term memory, enjoy the marginal shifts in my code style as I learn  
As a fun side-goal I will focus on having solutions that run as fast as possible, so some 'Improved' solutions after the initial solve may involve me researching better approaches and implementing them
